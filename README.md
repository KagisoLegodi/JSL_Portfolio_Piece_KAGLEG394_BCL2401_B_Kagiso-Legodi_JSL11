# Task Manager Debugging

## Issues Encountered

### Missing event listeners for several elements.
Several crucial elements lacked event listeners, leading to incomplete or incorrect user interactions.

### Incorrect handling of tasks and boards management.
Tasks and boards were not managed properly, resulting in issues such as incomplete task additions and inaccurate board updates.

### Incomplete or missing modal management functions.
Modal functionalities were incomplete or absent, causing disruptions in modal interactions and task editing.

### Code was not well organized and had some redundant or unnecessary parts.
The codebase suffered from poor organization, redundancy, and unnecessary components, making it challenging to maintain and comprehend.

## Solutions

### Data Initialization
- Added the `initializeData` function to initialize tasks and boards from `initialData` when the local storage is empty.

### Event Listeners
- Implemented event listeners for various elements like board buttons, theme switch, and modal buttons to ensure proper user interactions.

### Task and Board Management
- Fixed issues with managing tasks and boards by implementing functions like `addTaskToUI`, `filterAndDisplayTasksByBoard`, and `styleActiveBoard`.

### Modal Management
- Added functions such as `toggleModal`, `openEditTaskModal`, and `saveTaskChanges` to handle modal opening, closing, and user interactions within modals.

### Code Organization and Readability
- Restructured the codebase, eliminated redundancy, and enhanced overall readability to facilitate easier understanding and maintenance.

## Steps Taken

1. Added the `initializeData` function to handle data initialization.
2. Implemented event listeners for various elements to ensure proper user interactions.
3. Fixed issues with managing tasks and boards.
4. Added functions to handle modal opening, closing, and user interactions.
5. Restructured the codebase and improved readability for better maintainability.

These steps collectively addressed the encountered issues and significantly improved the functionality and usability of the Task Manager application.
